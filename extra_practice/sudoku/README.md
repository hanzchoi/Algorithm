 * Given a completed sudoku board, an array of arrays containing the solution,
 * check if the solution is valid or not.
 * In a valid solution, each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3
 * subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or
 * "subsquares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
